#What:
*I have implemented a tic tac toe game using c programming language.

#why:
*I implemnted it to test my learnings and concepts and to check whether I can implement my learnings or not.

#when:
*I programmed the code in the month of march'22 and uploaded it in my repo on 3rd April'22.

#who:
*coding enthusiasts, coding beginners, who loves to enjoy learnings, etc. are my target audiance.

#how:
*I have used c programming language to implement this project and have verified it on Dev C++ application software.




#strength:
*The code has no compilation error and is capable of performing the desired results

#weakness:
*I have a noticed that the interface which I designed could have been more attractive to the users.

#oppurtunity:
*this concepts can be used to implemnet more number of basic games and could make learnings more of fun.

#threats:
*this is a basic c programming code and can be easily challenged by implemnting the same idea using better development tools.



#features:
*A game for solo player to tackle boredom and on the other end making learning fun as a programming enthusiast.

#how tested:
*has been tested on Dev C++ application software.
